# freniche.com

This repo contains my personal web site. Here you´ll find all the source files that, when run through the static site generator  Hugo creates the final, static web site.

## How to use this code

You can use this site as a base for your next site. Please see Licenses below

To test this you´ll need to:

- install Hugo `brew install hugo`
- clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/dfreniche/freniche.com`
- `cd freniche.com`
- launch Hugo in server mode with `hugo server -D`
- open a browser pointing to `http://localhost:1313`
- done! You can now start changing things around and see what happens
