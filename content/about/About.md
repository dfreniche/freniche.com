# Hi there! 

I‚Äôm Diego, a Spanish Mobile Developer based in the warm sunny south of Spain. Seville is my home city and a beautiful place you should visit if haven‚Äôt done already. Ping me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dfreniche) if you‚Äôre visiting and we can arrange some üçªif time permits.

I‚Äôve been typing on keyboards since ‚Äò88, when my parents got me a nice cassette-loading, green-screen AMSTRAD CPC 464. Since then I‚Äôve been doing a lot of coding and just a few times I‚Äôve been proud of code punched by me. BASIC was my 1st language, followed by PASCAL, C, C++ and on and on.

These days I mostly do Swift and CoffeeScript working at The Best Company In The World, [Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com). If you want to apply there, send me a message because ~~referrals~~ I care. 

This is my web page, my little corner in the Internet. I‚Äôm putting here my blog, my projects, my CV, some notes about different things that interest me (mostly technical / about computers)

All this is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the static site generator and the beautiful [Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). So it‚Äôs just a bunch of HTML, CSS and very few JavaScript. No ads, no annoying pop-ups and specially no trackers. I respect you, the reader, and think you need places where your time is valued (fast loading), your privacy is a Basic Human Right and nobody is spying on you. This is inspired by the values of [Ethical Design](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/)

This is my other, rather funky, 80s AMSTRAD inspired [About page](old-index.html). Enter at your own risk.
