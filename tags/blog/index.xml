      <description>This time in English!
OK, I love to write. My old blog (in Spanish) is a testament to this. Lots of words were written there over many, many years. I also like to write fiction, but I’m so ashamed of everything I figure out that often I just compose things in my mind, where Facebook can’t read them (for now at least)
Wanted to write again for a while now, but been agonizing (and procrastinating over) deciding the most stupid of things.</description>
